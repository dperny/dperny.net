My personal site/portfolio done with Middleman.

Done using the latest HTML5 and CSS3. It is fully responsive and makes extensive use of
semantic HTML and CSS Flexboxes. 

I haven't tested it on these, but I suspect it will obliterate any browser older than IE 9 or 10.

If you like the site, feel free to fork it, redress it, whatever. It's MIT licensed.

Requires Ruby 2.1+ and all the gems in the gemfile.
